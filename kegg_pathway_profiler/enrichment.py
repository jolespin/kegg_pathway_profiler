    Perform unweighted set enrichment using Hypergeometric test (or Fisher Exact which is experimental)

    Args:
        features (set): Set of features to test
        feature_sets (dict): Feature sets with key as set set_name and value as feature set
        background_set (set, optional): Background feature set.  If None, then all features in `feature_sets` + `features` are used. [Defaults: None]
        test_method (str, optional): Type of test to use. Only {hypergeometric} is supported. [Defaults: "hypergeometric"]
        tol_test (float, optional): FDR threshold for signficance. [Defaults: 0.05]
        fdr_method (str, optional): FDR method 'bh' is for Benjamini-Hochberg, 'by' is for Benjaminini-Yekutieli. 
                                    The latter is more conservative, but it is guaranteed to control the FDR even 
                                    when the p-values are not from independent tests. [Defaults: "bh"]

    Raises:

    """
    Perform unweighted pathway enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test on the most complete paths in pathways.

    This function identifies the most complete paths within pathways from a KEGG pathway database, based on the presence 
    of KEGG Orthology (KO) terms in the evaluation set. The function then performs a hypergeometric test to assess the 
    enrichment of these pathways, returning a DataFrame of enrichment results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evaluation_kos : set
        A set of KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers representing the features (e.g., genes) present in the dataset.
        
    database : dict
        A dictionary containing pathway data, where each key is a pathway identifier and the value is another dictionary 
        with pathway-specific data, including:
            - 'graph': A directed graph (as a networkx.MultiDiGraph) representing the pathway structure.
            - 'ko_to_nodes': A dictionary mapping KO identifiers to the nodes/edges in the graph that they represent.

    background_set : set, optional
        A set of KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers representing the background set for the enrichment analysis. 
        If not provided, the union of all KO identifiers in the database will be used.

    progressbar_description : str, optional
        A description to display on the progress bar while processing pathways. Default is "Calculating enrichment for 
        most complete path in pathways:".

    **unweighted_set_enrichment_kws : dict
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the `unweighted_set_enrichment` function, which performs the actual 
        hypergeometric test for enrichment.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A pandas DataFrame containing the results of the pathway enrichment analysis. The DataFrame includes the 
        following columns:
            - 'p-value': The p-value from the hypergeometric test for enrichment.
            - 'odds_ratio': The odds ratio for enrichment.
            - 'intersecting_kos': The set of KO identifiers from the evaluation set that intersect with the pathway.
            - 'pathway_kos': The set of KO identifiers within the pathway.
            - Other columns may be added based on the output of the `unweighted_set_enrichment` function.

    Example
    -------
    >>> enrichment_results = unweighted_pathway_enrichment_wrapper(
    ...     evaluation_kos=my_kos, 
    ...     database=kegg_pathway_database,
    ...     background_set=all_kos
    ... )
    >>> print(enrichment_results.head())

    Notes
    -----
    This function first updates the edge weights in the pathway graphs based on the presence of KO identifiers in the 
    evaluation set. It then identifies the most complete paths within each pathway and calculates enrichment using the 
    hypergeometric test.
